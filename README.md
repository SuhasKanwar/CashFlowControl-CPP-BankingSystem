# CashFlowControl-CPP-BankingSystem
A C++ mini-project implementing a basic banking system. Users can perform operations such as account creation, displaying account info, depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds. Accounts are secured with passwords and include personal information. The code employs arrays to manage multiple accounts and tracks transaction counts.

Features

Account Creation: Users can open a new bank account by providing personal information such as name, phone number, age, Aadhaar number, guardian's name, and a secure password.

Account Information: Account holders can view their account information by entering their account number and password. The information includes the account holder's name, phone number, age, Aadhaar number, guardian's name, available balance, and total transaction count.

Deposit Money: Account holders can deposit money into their accounts by specifying the account number, password, and the amount to be deposited. The program updates the account balance and transaction count accordingly.

Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money from their accounts, provided they have sufficient funds. The program checks the account balance and processes the withdrawal, updating the balance and transaction count.

Funds Transfer: Account holders can transfer money to another account by entering their account number, password, the recipient's account number, and the transfer amount. The program verifies the transaction feasibility and updates the balances and transaction counts for both accounts.

Netbanking Interface: Users can interact with the banking system through a simple netbanking interface. The program presents a menu of options, allowing users to perform different banking operations.

Getting Started

To run the program, simply compile the source code and execute the generated executable. Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the netbanking interface and perform various banking operations.

Notes

The program uses arrays to store account-related information and performs basic validation checks.

It is designed for educational purposes and may not include advanced security features found in real-world banking systems.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance functionality or adapt it to specific requirements.
